Foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor Dr. Ivan Erill for
his continuous guidance and support throughout my Ph.D. study and research. I
am so fortunate to have an advisor who genuinely cares about his students in
every aspect.

I would also like to thank my dissertation committee members, Dr. Shiladitya
DasSarma, Dr. Jeffrey Gardner, Dr. Daniel Lobo and Dr. Hua Lu, for serving in
my committee.

I thank my labmates in Erill Lab: Robert Forder, Joseph Cornish, Dinara
Sagitova, Nikko Stewart, Talmo Pereira, David Nicholson. I would particularly
like to thank Patrick O'Neill who has been the best labmate that anyone could
have. In many ways I have learned so much from him.

My deepest appreciation goes to my family for their unconditional love and
support. I thank with love to my wife DoÄŸa. She has been with me all these
years and has made them the best years of my life. The last word goes for my
daughter Sena, who has been the greatest joy of my life for the last two
years. This dissertation is dedicated to her.
